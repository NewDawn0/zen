## Infos

**Notice:** The files `project.py` and `test_project.py` provided in this
repository, altough functional, are not intended for direct usage. Instead, they are utilized to
satisfy the requirements of the CS50 checker. The primary functionality of this project resides in `zen/main.py`, as described in the primary README located at [README.md](https://github.com/NewDawn0/zen/blob/main/README.md). Therefore, It is recommended to follow the instructions outlined in the [README.md](https://github.com/NewDawn0/zen/blob/main/README.md) for installing and experimenting with the project. Likewise, the tests for the project can be found under the `tests` directory.

## Challenges and Hardships

During the development process, I encountered several challenges, including:

- Missing data types like `uint`, commonly found in languages like C, C++, Go,
  and Rust.
- Issues with Python's import system, leading to potential circular imports and
  clashes, which were mitigated by organizing global variables into separate
  files in the `utils/globals` directory.
