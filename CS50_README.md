## Infos

**Note:** The files `project.py` and `test_project.py` provided in this
repository are not intended for direct usage. Instead, they are utilized to
satisfy the requirements of the CS50 checker. The actual main function of the
project resides in `zen/main.py`, as described in the primary README located at
[README.md](https://github.com/NewDawn0/zen/blob/main/README.md). Similarly, the
tests for the project can be found under the `tests` directory.

## Challenges and Hardships

During the development process, I encountered several challenges, including:

- Missing data types like `uint`, commonly found in languages like C, C++, Go,
  and Rust.
- Issues with Python's import system, leading to potential circular imports and
  clashes, which were mitigated by organizing global variables into separate
  files in the `utils/globals` directory.
